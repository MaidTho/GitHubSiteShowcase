UPDATE 1.0 - August 4 2024

Created and Added about, contact, home, login, and portfolio pages adding better functionality and a dynamic flow. Made it so the index has users see only the logo, to then give the nav bar more functionality. Home page now acts as the previous index page, while index page shows only the logo.

To be added - Login Forms, update other pages to only show their respective content.
